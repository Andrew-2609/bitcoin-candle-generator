# Bitcoin Candle Generator

## About the project
This simple project uses data from [Coin Gecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)'s API to generate candles. Then, these candles are enqueued in RabbitMQ to be consumed by another API.

## Used technologies
This project is made with **TypeScript**, and the application connects to a RabbitMQ **Docker** container using **docker-compose**.

## How to run it
1. Firstly, install the project dependencies by running `yarn install`.

2. Secondly, you need to create a `.env` file. You can use the base `.env.example` file from the project root to know the environment variables required in this application and how they should look like.

3. Then, make sure that the RabbitMQ *Docker container* is up and running. You can do this by simply running `docker-compose up`.

4. Finally, you can start the application by running `yarn start`, and see the magic happening in the console.

## How to see the enqueued Candles
You can monitor the RabbitMQ queue by accessing `localhost:15672` in your browser.

### What are Candles?
Candles are the base elements of a Candlestick Chart. 

According to [Groww](https://groww.in/blog/how-to-read-candlestick-charts), "Candlesticks are a visual representation of the size of price fluctuations. Traders use these charts to identify patterns and gauge the near-term direction of price".

### What is [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com)?
RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.
